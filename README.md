##Project Goal

Commercial fantasy football draft apps don't have useful features unlocked in base versions or flatout don't operate the way I need them to. The goal of this
project is mostly to learn full stack integration but also build an app that I will have use for.

##Technologies

Project will be built with Java, PostgreSQL and vue.js. 

##Goals for MVP

*User can create a draft, selecting the number of teams and manually assigning names or auto generating generic names
*User can create their own rankings of players or use a default ranking
*During draft the app will make user aware of bye week conflicts for positions, team conflicts and position depth
*During draft the app will highlight WRs with QBs still available and vice versa 
*Players will be represented with their rank, team, position, age(possibly more if app becomes integrated with outside API source)
